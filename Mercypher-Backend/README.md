# Mercypher Backend

End-to-end encrypted chat app backend built on a scalable microservice architecture.

Mercypher ensures secure and private messaging by implementing modern encryption standards, with each message encrypted client-side before transmission. This backend is composed of decoupled microservices, enabling horizontal scalability, service isolation, and independent deployment.

## 🔐 Features

- End-to-end encryption (E2EE) using modern cryptographic libraries  
- Stateless message relay via secure transport  
- Scalable microservices for authentication, messaging, storage, and presence  

## 🚀 Technologies

- Go 
- PostgreSQL / Redis  
- Docker + Kubernetes (for orchestration)  

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repo contains backend logic only. The client-side encryption and UI are handled in the [Mercypher Client](#) repository.
